# Write a password generator in Python.
# Be creative with how you generate passwords - strong
# passwords have a mix of lowercase letters, uppercase letters,
# numbers, and symbols. The passwords should be random,
# generating a new password every time the user asks for a new password.
# Include your run-time code in a main method.

# Extra:
# â€¢ Ask the user how strong they want their password to be. For weak passwords, pick a word or two from a list.
